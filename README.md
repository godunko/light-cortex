Light GNAT Runtime startup files and linker scripts
---------------------------------------------------

Experimental work to complement `light-cortex-m*` GNAT runtimes by startup
code and linker scripts for some boards. All code are written in Ada (there is
no Asm or C code).

Supported boards:
 - Arduino Due (SAM3X8E, Cortex-M3)
